This is the detail configuration as used by the playbooks, and the CI pipelines. This information is divided into sections for each organization.
There is 'public' information that is shared between the organizations, and there is some information that will be specific and private. 
Everything is shown here in a 'flat format'. In production setting with different clusters and organizations it would be expected that this information would be pulled
from a secure store.
